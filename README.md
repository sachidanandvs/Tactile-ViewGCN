# Learning the signatures of the human grasp using a scalable tactile glove

## Introduction
This is a Pytorch based code for object classification and object estimation methods presented in the paper "Learning the signatures of the human grasp using a scalable tactile glove".

It relies on Pytorch 0.4.1 (or newer) and the dataset that can be downloaded separately from [http://humangrasp.io](http://humangrasp.io) .


## System requirements

Requires CUDA and Python 3.6+ with following packages (exact version may not be necessary):

* numpy (1.15.4)
* torch (0.4.1)
* torchfile (0.1.0)
* torchvision (0.2.1)
* scipy (1.1.0)
* scikit-learn (0.19.1)

## Dataset preparation

1. Download the `classification` and/or `weights` dataset from [http://humangrasp.io](http://humangrasp.io) .
2. Extract the dataset metadata.mat files to a sub-folder `data\[task]`. The resulting structure should be something like this:
```
data
|--classification
|    |--metadata.mat
|--weights
        |--metadata.mat
```
The images in the dataset are for illustration only and are not used by this code. More information about the dataset structure is availble in [http://humangrasp.io](http://humangrasp.io) .

3. Alternatively, extract the dataset to a different folder and use a runtime argument `--dataset [path to metadata.mat]` to specify its location.

## Object classification

Run the code from the root working directory (the one containing this readme).

### Training
You can train a model from scratch for `N` input frames using:
```
python classification/main.py --reset --nframes N
```
You can change the location of the saved snapshots using `--snapshotDir YOUR_PATH`.

### Testing
You can test the provided pretrained model using:
```
python classification/main.py --test --nframes N
```

## History
Any necessary changes to the dataset will be documented here.

* **May 2019**: Original code released.
